 # 🦝 The Raccoon Code of Honor — A Universal Guide to Living

🔥 1. Burn Bright

Let your curiosity and creativity shine like moonlight on water.
Every raccoon carries a spark of wonder, courage, and curiosity. To burn bright is to live fully, to explore boldly, and to never let fear dim your inner light.

😊 2. Inspire Happiness

Bring joy wherever your little paws tread.
A raccoon’s presence should lift others — with laughter, kindness, and shared adventure. Happiness shared is never lost.

🛡️ 3. Harm Only in Defense

Fight only to protect, never to dominate.
Claws are for climbing and hearts are for caring. Use strength with purpose and restraint.

❤️ 4. Share Love

Give warmth as freely as the moon gives light.
Love binds the raccoon family — in dens, in friendships, and in the quiet moments between foraging and rest. To share love is to strengthen the spirit of the whole.

🌎 5. Protect Life

Every leaf, stream, and creature has its place in the grand circle.
A raccoon defends the balance of nature, respecting all who share the night.
